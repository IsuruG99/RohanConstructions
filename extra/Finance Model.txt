Finance Model

Project Added/Created
+ Budget allocation

Upon Project Completion
- Expenses per assigned (May depend on time taken)
	- Resource
	- Manpower
	
Monthly/Weekly?
- Salary for permanent employees
- Expenses for Supplier Contracts

Unit Quantity and InStock/OutOfStock
Manager updates manually
Purely to keep track, will manually notify suppliers if resources are out of stock

User Tracking
- Every Finance Log will have a Related_User f  ield, to track who made   the changes


To-do (For Myself) :
- Resources: Subtract function on assignment
- Understand Finance Reports (Financial Report Popup?Window, Format, Structure)
- Export a Report (?)
- Create Account Functionality? (Delete too i guess)
- Access Controls V3+ (Postponed till every function complete)
- Client Function may need an Active Inactive filter (projects.py includes a list for this if needed)

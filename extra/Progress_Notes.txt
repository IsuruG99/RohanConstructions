To-Do List:
- Project Report (Make the Dates look YYYY %B %d)

FINAL TASK: Complete (Project Archive Conversion Implemented)

Optional
- Client Function may need an Active Inactive filter (projects.py includes a list for this if needed)
- Images for Employees (Optional), it is python, of course it can do that
- Export a Report (?)

Best moments in project(Coding) so far:
- Learning Kivy's dynamics
- Creating the dropdown Textbox custom widget
- Creating the custom confirm message box. (Pretty much the hardest obstacle in the project, did it recursively instead).
- Patient Zero for every node in firebase
- Access Control Structure & Admin Panel
- Figuring out the resource assignments (i did not expect it to require + -)
- The way the project completion will work, and how it will connect to the finance function
- I HATE ROUNDED EVERYTHING (On kivy, literally spent 2 weeks on nothing but visuals)
- Rounded Popup was an absolute cinema, the content encapsulation and triple class inheritance was a nightmare
- Moving the pieChart forcefully with manual positioning over 1 hour and half
- Decorators are awesome

Finance Model

Project Added/Created
+ Budget allocation

Upon Project Completion
- Expenses per assigned (May depend on time taken)
	- Resource
	- Manpower
	
Monthly/Weekly?
- Salary for permanent employees
- Expenses for Supplier Contracts

Unit Quantity and InStock/OutOfStock
Manager updates manually
Purely to keep track, will manually notify suppliers if resources are out of stock

User Tracking
- Every Finance Log will have a Related_User field, to track who made the changes
- User Logins are Tracked
- Admin Controls are accessible to Both Access Lv1 & 0
- 0 Being the person we train to use the system's admin functions
- Lv0 users can edit all users, while Lv1 Cannot see admin users (Access 0).

BrainStorming :
- Users
- Who are users? (Trained Admin (0), Owner & Manager (1), Assistant (2), Receptionist (3))
- Privileges (based on above, what do you think)
    0: Full Access (Super Admin)
    1: View & Edit All. Limited Admin Controls
    2: View All, Edit Resources/Manpower (To pay salaries and update resources)
    3: View Everything Except Finances
- Main Computers that use these roles
    0: Main Admin Computer, only a trained worker will use this.
    1: Rohan and maybe 1 more manager's computer
    2: Assistant Manager's Computer
    3: The computer near the reception, customer support phone, that's why i named it receptionist

- Understand the Project Completion complexity first
    (Concept: Project Completion -> Budget - Allocated Res & Manpower)
    - Give them a editable budget popup at project completion?
    - Autofill with calculated current assigned data, and allow manual changes
    - Once submitted, it will be added to the finances
        - Generated Finance Log Models (Different ways to do it, a log will only have name, desc and price, can't complicate it)
            Pick One
            1. Budget Allocation Log, Resource Allocation Log, Manpower Allocation Log
            2. One Log as Completion, include final calculated price
            3. ... ?

- Understand Finance Reports (Financial Report Popup?Window, Format, Structure)

To-Do List:
- Rounded Borders now for buttons, what am i doing with my life...
- Apply RPopup to message box
- Redo the structure of popups
- If anushka gives 1 more different UI well.... good luck to me
- Get Refs will crash without internet, implement blank return
- Supplier & Client Overview structure (Popup made, format and structure unknown)
- Access Controls V3+ (Postponed till every function complete)
- Client Function may need an Active Inactive filter (projects.py includes a list for this if needed)

FINAL TASK: (After ALL Above)
- Project Completion connectivity to Finance function and Budget calculation.

Optional
-
- Export a Report (?)

Best moments in project(Coding) so far:
- Learning Kivy's dynamics
- Creating the dropdown Textbox custom widget
- Creating the custom confirm message box. (Pretty much the hardest obstacle in the project, did it recursively instead).
- Patient Zero for every node in firebase
- Access Control Structure & Admin Panel
- Figuring out the resource assignments (i did not expect it to require + -)
- The way the project completion will work, and how it will connect to the finance function
- I HATE ROUNDED EVERYTHING (On kivy, literally spent 2 weeks on nothing but visuals)
